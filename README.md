# Context

Client: Family memebers who want to show off our dog to others

Goal: to create a page where I can show others pictures of my dog (aside from Instagram), and so people can inquire about having doggy play-dates. My dog is quite old, so it would be a great way to remember his best years.

## Assignment 1

Assignment one is on home page index.html, simple landing page that connects to second page - about me

I started on assignment two, by adding a page to my "about me" section

- about me section should have cards about owners, and also more information on congee

## Honorable Mentions

- Kyle Welsh - Helped me so much, 10/10
- Karen Sule - Also great support group
- Vitaly Gins - Overall really helpful and helps me make sure I didn't miss anything on my assignments
