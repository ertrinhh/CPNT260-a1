# Context

Client: Family memebers who want to show off our dog to others

Goal: to create a page where I can show others pictures of my dog (aside from Instagram), and so people can inquire about having doggy play-dates. My dog is quite old, so it would be a great way to remember his best years.

## Assignment 1

Assignment one is on home page index.html

I started on assignment two, by adding a page to my "about me" section

- Vitaly Gins - Overall really helpful and helps me make sure I didn't miss anything on my assignments
